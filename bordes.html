      I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
      I know it's hard sometimes
      Pieces of peace in sun's peace of mind
      I know it's hard sometimes. Yeah, I think about the end just way too much
      But it's fun to fantasize
      All my enemies who wouldn't wish who I was
      But it's fun to fantasize</p>

      I'm falling, so I'm taking my time on my ride
      I'm falling, so I'm taking my time on my ride
      Taking my time on my ride. I'd die for you, that's easy to say
      We have a list of people that we would take
      A bullet for them, a bullet for you
      A bullet for everybody in this room
      </p>
     
     <p class="parr-style" id="dos">But I don't seem to see many bullets coming through. See many bullets coming through
      Metaphorically, I'm the man
      But, literally, I don't know what I'd do
      I'd live for you and that's hard to do. Even harder to say when you know it's not true</p>
     
     <p class="parr-style" id="tres">
      Even harder to write when you know that tonight
      There were people back home who tried talking to you
      But then you ignore them still
      All these questions, theyâ€™re for real
      Like who would you live for?
      Who would you die for?
      And would you ever kill?</p>
     
     <p class="parr-style" id="cuatro">I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
      I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
      Taking my time on my ride
      
      I've been thinking too much
      I've been thinking too much
      I've been thinking too much
      I've been thinking too much
      Help me</p>
